<h1>OS Notes</h1>

<h2>Supported Environments</h2>

<p>This tool is supported in the following environments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 7</li>
  <li>Windows 10</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Under Ubuntu, ensure the user is in the dialout group.
    <p class="folder">sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER</p>
  <li>Under Ubuntu, the "libstdc++.so.6" file is only needed for 14.04 LTS.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the directories that the log configuration file refers to</li>
  exist because the logging system silently discards log messages if the destination directory does not exist.</li>
  <li>Under Windows, there is a known problem with accessing the serial port.  To work around the problem perform either of the following. This only
  needs to be performed once after rebooting or attaching the USB serial port.
    <ul>
      <li>Use a third party application (e.g. PuTTY, Realterm, or Tera Term) to open the serial port.</li>
      <li>Execute the supplied python script (windows\serialPort.py)
      <p class="folder">python serialPort.py</p></li>
      </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
